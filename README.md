The app is designed to enhance internet safety and privacy, specifically for women, by offering a comprehensive solution that covers education, protection, and legal guidance. It operates with the goal of detecting harmful content and protecting users from cyber threats.

Functionality: Educational Tools: The app provides information about cybersecurity and privacy, offering motivational stories and success cases to empower users. Protection Features: It allows users to test the strength of their passwords, check URLs for malicious intent, and automatically detect harassment or inappropriate content in messages. Chatbot Support: When a malicious URL or bad message is detected, the app activates a chatbot to provide guidance, advice, or assistance to the user. Technology and Structure: The project is divided into two parts:

Project 28 Files: These files handle the appâ€™s different interfaces. The user can navigate through various pages that provide educational resources, protection tools, and motivational content. Each page is designed to be user-friendly and easily accessible.

Development of Prediction Models: The other folder focuses on the backend development:

URL Prediction: A machine learning model is developed to predict whether a URL is malicious, cross-verified with famous databases for accuracy. Harassment Detection: A deep learning model is used to detect harassment in messages or comments. Chatbot Development: The chatbot is triggered whenever the app detects harmful messages or URLs, providing real-time interaction with the user to guide them through the issue and recommend necessary actions.
